## My Story <br>
A few years back I wanted to try out speaking at events to give back to the community. Like most everyone else I was worried about how well I'd do, if my presentations would have any value and if anyone would even show up and if they did, would they throw tomatoes at me when I sucked. Here's what I learned:

People think when they get one stage 1 of 2 things will happen: either people will applaud that they are geniuses or they will throw tomatoes because they are horrible. The truth is some people will play on their phone or do something unreleated to being there, some will simply pay attention, a handful will really walk away growing from the interactions and most people will think the interaction was fair and reasonable. No craziness, not standing ovations and being pelted with flowers. Just a nice interaciton where you share your viewpoint and others will resonate or not.

As time went on I learned how to hone my craft by reading anyhting I could get my hands on and going to talks that I didnt know anything about and taking notes on how the presenter presented and how thier content was structured and how people responded. Never miss an opportunity to take advantage of the time you have at a conference ot learn form as many other people as you can. The more diversity, the more value.

Fast forward 2 years, now with over 37 events, 51 talks and 2 keynotes, an instructor role and global ambassador position in my field later and I've learned a lot and grown a lot from the experiences. Not to mention the massive amount of friends I've made and people I've helped and I'll tell you the same I told them, if I can do it, so can you!
