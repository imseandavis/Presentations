## Introduction
If you're a developer or engineer looking to start building or migrating to Azure, then you're going to want the help of Azure Resource Manager (ARM). Gone are the days of submitting tickets or filling out build sheets for servers, developers can now integrate infrastructure directly into their codebase. ARM allows you to deploy, manage, and monitor resources programmatically. Making the efforts of managing resources for multiple environments, applications, and configurations simple, easy, and updatable with the push of a button.
 
 You will learn how to leverage native (and free!) tools to deliver or migrate your application to the Azure cloud. Weâ€™ll begin by talking about the tools needed to build our new ARM templates, then you'll learn how to leverage VSTS CI/CD pipeline to deploy your templates into several environments with approval gating or simultaneously deployment. Then you'll see a demonstration of how easily and quickly a sample application can be brought from code to delivery in less than a few minutes. Finally, you'll be given a library of over 100 open source templates and all the presentation scripts and samples to get you started with your own ARM creations and migrations.
