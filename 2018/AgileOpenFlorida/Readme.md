This repo contains the resource and presentation information for my 2018 AgileOpen Florida Session. This was an Agile OpenSpace event so everything was created on the fly as the sesison was held and upheld the OpenSpace rules. <br>
This was my first ever OpenSpace session and I loved it, I highly encourage anyone who is interested ot get involved, I've included informaiton below.
