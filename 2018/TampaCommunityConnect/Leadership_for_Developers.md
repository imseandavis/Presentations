## Introduction
Leadership and management are commonly mistaken as the same thing, which can hamper your success not only in your career but in your personal life and even in your community. Leadership occurs at all levels of the organization but can sometimes be challenging in certain team formations. In this session, we will focus on developer challenges around becoming a leader in your team and organization. Learn how to create and capitalize on opportunities as a leader in a developer role and how to get the most out of your time, foster stronger and more meaningful relationships, create valuable feedback loops, and how to develop and mentor others responsibly. This session will focus on simplicity and common business practices used by some of the largest organizations in the world. See how meritocracy, increasing organizational thought diversity, developing paint drip skills, collaborating cross-functionally and cultural influence can make a significant impact in all areas of your life.
