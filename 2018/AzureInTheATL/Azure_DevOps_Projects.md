# Thank You
I wanted to start with a big thank you to all that attended!! You are the reason I keep doing these events and your dedication to the group and this community never ceases to impress me. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your valuable time and the opportunity to learn and grow with you.

## Introduction
This repo contains the source code for a simple demonstration of my 2018 Azure In The ATL presentation on Azure DevOps Projects. The purpose of this project is to educate anyone interested in Azure to learn more about a single pane of glass tool to manage your entire DevOps pipeline.

## Experiment Metrics
---------------------
For those who know me I take my place in the community and presentations seriously. In the vein of transparency. If you'd like a peek behind the curtain I've included all the information about the experiments I ran this presentation, what metrics I look at and how I improve. The experiment for this presentation was around how to measure success of presentation execution.<br><br>


### Success Criteria
* Total Audience Survey Engagement - 80% or Greater <br>
* Presentation Length - Between 60m - 70m with Q&A <br>
* Time Lost To Tech Debt (10%) - 6m <br>
* Presentation Waste - Less Than 5m

| Total Time         |                      | 1h 4m 30s        |


### Demo vs. Slide Breakdown
This measures time actually used and how it was spent. This is nonrelational to the projected 60m, rather it uses actual used time to calculate for obvious reasons. <br>

| Activity                 | Total Time Spent     | Presentation Time % | Target % | Delta % |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Demo / Walkthrough Time  | 28m 30s              | 44.19%              | 50%      | -5.81%  |
| Slide Time               | 36m                  | 55.81%              | 50%      | +5.81%  |


### Technical Debt (Tech Problems / Challenges / Overhead)
This measures the amount of technical debt, it's cause and the presentation decisions that diverted from normal practice. They could be used to link all, some, or none of the problems.<br>
* Chose To Try Mirra Cast vs. HDMI Cable
* Recorded Entire Session - Camera Management Overhead
* New Presentation Format - 50 (Demo) /50 (Slides)
* New Survey Format

| Event                         | Time Lost |
| ----------------------------- | --------- |
| Connect To Projector          | 25s       |
| Intro Survey Not Working      | 3m        |
| Time Delays From Mirracast    | 1m 20s    |
| ----------------------------- | --------- |
| Total Time                    | 4m 45s    |


### Presentation Waste
Presentation Time (1h 4m 25s) - Tech Debt (4m 45s) = **Total Time Delivering Value (59m 15s)** <br>
Presentation Time (1h 4m 25s) - Target Time (60m) = **Waste (4m 25s - 6.86%)**


### Presentation Retro (Feedback and Observations)
* What Went Well
  - Audience - Food was great
  - Audience - Overall Survey Sentiment: Great Presentation
  - Audience - Loved The Presentation and Demos
  - Audience - Loved The Technical Focus and Not Sales Focused

* What Didn't Go So Well?
  - Speaker - Camera placement and audio may need to be adjusted in the future, Couldn't hear sound well at times
  - Audience - Get a better projector - Display was slow and blurry (4 complaints)
  - Audience - Need Better Lighting

* What I Learned?
  - Speaker - Favored looking at the right side of the room
  - Speaker - Keep starting new slides with the word "So" a lot
  - Speaker - Move the DevOps Projects menu bar to the start of the animations on the Devops Projects navigation slide
  - Audience - People prefer water to soda 5 to 1
  - Audience - Add something about pricing of DevOps Projects to the slide deck
  - Audience - Be more clear about what DevOps Projects is and what it isn't in this context as DevOps is a very interchangeable word, challenge was some may have though DevOps projects was an approach, not an actual Microsoft product offering on Azure.

* What Still Puzzles Me?
  - Speaker - How to more effectively order enough food and drinks based on signups vs. actual attendance.
  - Speaker - How to get more audience participation in polls / demos / q&a

### Did I Succeed Based On Audience Feedback And Success Metrics
| SUCCESS / FAIL | Success Criteria             | Metric     | Calculation                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | 
| FAIL           | Audience Survey Engagement   | > 80%      | Attendees (31) / Participants (24) = 77.4%   |
| SUCCESS        | Presentation Length          | 60m - 70m  | 1h 4m 25s                                    |
| SUCCESS        | Technical Debt               | < 6m       | 4m 45s                                       |
| SUCCESS!       | Presentation Waste           | < 5m       | 4m 25s                                       |

Overall, I believe this was a great success, I have learned a lot from the experience and experiements. Still great engagement and barely missed the mark. I now have some ideas on how to improve a few different things in the future. I've alos found a new solutions for wireless presentation as well as a ideas around improving engagement next time. I look forward to the next time we have the opportunity to learn and grow together!
